This project implements the cmath functions and some optimised matrix functions 
with the aim of increasing the floating point performance of ARM Cortex A-8
based platforms. As well as implementing the functions in ARM NEON assembly, 
they sacrifice error checking and accuracy to achieve better performance.


Function List:
sinf, cosf, tanf, expf, logf,  asinf, acosf, atanf, atan2f, coshf, sinhf, tanhf, 

Notes:
	- The *_c functions are c implementations of the *_neon code.
	- Like cmath, The errors present in the functions are very dependent on the 
	  range which your operating in. So you should test them first.
