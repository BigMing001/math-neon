This project implements the cmath functions and some optimised matrix functions 
with the aim of increasing the floating point performance of ARM Cortex A-8
based platforms. As well as implementing the functions in ARM NEON assembly, 
they sacrifice error checking and accuracy to achieve better performance.

Notes:
	- The *_c functions are c implementations of the *_neon code.
	- Like cmath, The errors present in the functions are very dependent on the 
	  range which your operating in. So you should test them first.
	- Look in the "math_neon.h" file for discriptions of the functions. In some 
	  function files there are also notes on the specific implementation.
	- The *_neon functions make certain assumptions about the location of arguments 
	  that is incompatible with inlining.
